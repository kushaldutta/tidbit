## 💡 Feature Ideas (Prioritized)

### **Tier 1: Core Active Learning (Days 1-5)**
*Must-have features that transform the app into a learning tool*

#### 1. **Study Plan Card** ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY
**What**: A daily "Study Plan" card on the Home screen that generates a personalized study session.

**Features**:
- **Daily Plan Generation**: Every day, automatically creates a study plan:
  - "Do 6 due reviews + 4 new (10 min)"
  - Balances due tidbits (spaced repetition) with new learning
  - Estimates time based on tidbit count
- **One-Tap Start**: Tap the card to immediately start the session
- **Smart Mixing**: Combines:
  - Due tidbits (from spaced repetition)
  - New tidbits (from selected categories)
  - Ratio: ~60% due, ~40% new (adjustable)
- **Daily Refresh**: Plan regenerates each day based on current state
- **Progress Indicator**: Shows if plan is completed: "✅ Completed" or "0/10 done"

**Why**: Eliminates decision fatigue. Users know exactly what to do each day. Combines review + new learning in one actionable plan.

**UI Flow**:
- Prominent card at top of Home screen (below stats)
- Shows: "📚 Today's Study Plan: 6 due + 4 new (10 min)"
- Tap → Immediately starts study session with pre-selected tidbits
- After completion: Card shows "✅ Completed" or updates progress

**Technical**:
- New `StudyPlanService.js` to generate daily plans
- Algorithm: Get due tidbits, get new tidbits, mix them
- Store plan in AsyncStorage (daily reset)
- Integrate with Study Session Mode

**Study Plan Algorithm**:
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for plan generation
function generateDailyPlan() {
  // 1. Get due tidbits (from SpacedRepetitionService)
  const dueTidbits = await SpacedRepetitionService.getDueTidbits();
  
  // 2. Get new tidbits (from ContentService, not seen before)
  const newTidbits = await ContentService.getNewTidbits(selectedCategories);
  
  // 3. Calculate mix (60% due, 40% new)
  const dueCount = Math.min(dueTidbits.length, Math.ceil(totalCount * 0.6));
  const newCount = totalCount - dueCount;
  
  // 4. Select random subset
  const selectedDue = shuffle(dueTidbits).slice(0, dueCount);
  const selectedNew = shuffle(newTidbits).slice(0, newCount);
  
  // 5. Mix them together (shuffle order)
  const planTidbits = shuffle([...selectedDue, ...selectedNew]);
  
  // 6. Estimate time (assume ~1 min per tidbit)
  const estimatedMinutes = planTidbits.length;
  
  return {
    tidbits: planTidbits,
    dueCount,
    newCount,
    totalCount: planTidbits.length,
    estimatedMinutes,
    date: today(),
    completed: false
  };
}
```

**Plan Configuration**:
- Default total: 10 tidbits (adjustable in settings)
