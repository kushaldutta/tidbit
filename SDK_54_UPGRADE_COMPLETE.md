# ✅ SDK 54 Upgrade Complete!

## What We Did

1. ✅ Upgraded Expo from SDK 49 to SDK 54
2. ✅ Updated all dependencies to match SDK 54
3. ✅ Removed conflicting webpack config

## Now Try Again!

1. **Stop your current server** (Ctrl+C if it's running)

2. **Start fresh:**
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

3. **In Expo Go on your phone:**
   - Pull down to refresh on Home tab
   - Your server should appear!
   - OR scan the QR code again
   - It should work now! ✅

## What Should Happen

- Server starts with SDK 54
- QR code shows in terminal
- Expo Go recognizes it (SDK 54 matches!)
- App loads on your phone!

## If It Still Doesn't Auto-Appear

The QR code should definitely work now. Just scan it and the app should load!

Try it now and let me know if it works! 🎉
