# Use This Tunnel URL

## Your Tunnel Connection URL

Based on what we saw earlier, your tunnel URL is:

```
exp://o3pcnr8.anonymous.8081.exp.direct:80
```

## How to Connect

Since Expo Go isn't auto-discovering the server, let's try a different approach:

### Method 1: Try Opening the URL Directly

1. **On your phone**, open a **web browser** (Chrome, Safari)
2. **Type this in the address bar:**
   ```
   http://o3pcnr8.anonymous.8081.exp.direct
   ```
3. It might redirect to Expo Go or show connection options

### Method 2: Use Expo Go's Hidden URL Entry

Some versions of Expo Go have a hidden way to enter URLs:

1. **Open Expo Go**
2. **On the Home tab**, try:
   - **Long press** (hold) on the screen for 2-3 seconds
   - **Double tap** on "Development servers" text
   - **Triple tap** anywhere on the screen
   - Look for a context menu or options

### Method 3: Check Expo Go Version

The URL entry feature might not be in your version:

1. **Update Expo Go** from App Store/Play Store
2. **Restart the app**
3. **Try again**

### Method 4: Use the Browser DevTools

1. **On your computer**, open: `http://localhost:8081`
2. **Look for a QR code** or connection URL in the page
3. **Scan the QR code** with Expo Go's camera (if available)

## Quick Test

Try this URL in your phone's browser:
```
http://o3pcnr8.anonymous.8081.exp.direct
```

Or try the exp:// version if your phone has a way to handle it.
