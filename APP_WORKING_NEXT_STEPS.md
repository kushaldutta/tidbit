# 🎉 App is Working! Next Steps

## ✅ What's Working

- **App is running in browser** at `localhost:19006` ✅
- **All features are visible** - Home, Categories, Stats tabs ✅
- **Server is running** - Metro bundler is active ✅
- **Tunnel is connected** - Ready for phone connection ✅

## About localhost:8081

The JSON you see at `localhost:8081` is **normal** - that's the Metro bundler's manifest endpoint. It's not an error, it's just the server's configuration data.

## Test the App in Browser First!

Now that it's working, let's test all the features:

1. **Click "Manage Categories"** - Select/deselect categories
2. **Click "Test Tidbit (Dev)"** - See if a tidbit modal appears
3. **Navigate to Categories tab** - See all available categories
4. **Navigate to Stats tab** - View statistics

## For Phone Connection

Your tunnel URL is: `exp://o3pcnr8.anonymous.8081.exp.direct:80`

Since Expo Go isn't auto-discovering, let's try:

### Option 1: Generate QR Code

We can create a QR code with your tunnel URL that you can scan.

### Option 2: Development Build

Create a standalone app you install directly (more reliable).

### Option 3: Keep Trying Expo Go

Sometimes it takes a few tries or a specific Expo Go version.

## For Now: Test Everything in Browser!

Try clicking around:
- ✅ Test the tidbit display
- ✅ Change categories  
- ✅ Check stats
- ✅ Navigate between tabs

Let me know what works and what doesn't - then we'll tackle the phone connection!
