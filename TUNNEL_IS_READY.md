# Tunnel is Ready! Connect Now

## ✅ Your Tunnel is Connected!

I can see:
- "Tunnel connected."
- "Tunnel ready."
- Server is running on `http://localhost:8081`

## Connect Your Phone NOW:

### Step 1: In Expo Go App

1. **Open Expo Go** on your phone
2. **Go to Home tab**
3. **Pull down to refresh** (swipe down from top)
4. **Your tunnel server should appear!**

It might show as:
- `exp://o3pcnr8.anonymous.8081.exp.direct:80`
- Or just "Tidbit" or your project name
- Or "Anonymous Project"

### Step 2: Tap to Connect

- **Tap on the server** that appears
- The app should start loading!

## If It Still Doesn't Appear:

### Option A: Update Expo Go
1. **Go to App Store/Play Store**
2. **Update Expo Go** to the latest version
3. **Restart the app**
4. **Pull down to refresh** again

### Option B: Restart Expo Go
1. **Close Expo Go completely** (swipe it away)
2. **Reopen it**
3. **Go to Home tab**
4. **Pull down to refresh**

### Option C: Check Tunnel Status

In your terminal, you should see the tunnel is ready. Make sure the server is still running (don't close the terminal).

## The Tunnel URL

Your tunnel URL is: `exp://o3pcnr8.anonymous.8081.exp.direct:80`

This should automatically appear in Expo Go when you pull to refresh on the Home tab.

## Try This Right Now:

1. **Keep the server running** (don't close terminal)
2. **Open Expo Go** on phone
3. **Home tab** → **Pull down to refresh**
4. **Look for your server** in the list
5. **Tap it!**

The tunnel is ready - it should work now! Let me know if it appears when you refresh.
