# Use This Connection URL

## Your Connection URL:

Based on your network, use this URL in Expo Go:

```
exp://10.0.0.8:8081
```

## How to Connect:

1. **Open Expo Go app** on your phone
2. **Make sure your phone and computer are on the SAME Wi-Fi network**
3. **Find the URL input field** in Expo Go:
   - Look in "Projects" tab → "+" button
   - Or home screen search bar
   - Or any text input field
4. **Enter:** `exp://10.0.0.8:8081`
5. **Tap Connect/Go**

## If That Doesn't Work:

Try the HTTP version:
```
http://10.0.0.8:8081
```

## Important:

- Your phone and computer MUST be on the same Wi-Fi network
- The server should be running (you should see "Waiting on http://localhost:8081" in terminal)
- If you get connection errors, check your firewall isn't blocking port 8081

## Quick Test:

1. Server running? ✅ (You see "waiting on localhost:8081")
2. Phone on same WiFi? ✅
3. Open Expo Go → Enter: `exp://10.0.0.8:8081`
4. Should connect!

Try that URL and let me know what happens!
